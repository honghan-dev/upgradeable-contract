# UUPS Upgradeable Contract Example

A minimalist implementation of an upgradeable smart contract using the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern with OpenZeppelin's contracts.

## About

This project demonstrates:

- Basic UUPS upgradeable contract implementation
- Proper initialization pattern for upgradeable contracts
- Secure upgrade mechanisms
- Testing upgrade functionality
- Deployment scripts for proxy and implementation contracts

## Contract Architecture

### Key Components:

1. **Implementation Contract**
   - Core business logic
   - UUPS upgrade mechanism
   - Access control for upgrades

2. **Proxy Contract**
   - Delegates calls to implementation
   - Stores contract state
   - Handles upgrade functionality
